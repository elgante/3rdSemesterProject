# CenterSprog
## SEP3 Project - 2023

### System information
A distributed system consisting of 3 tiers; *Presentation Tier* implemented as a **Blazor Server Application**, *Business Logic Tier* with **C#**, and *Data Tier* done in **Java** using **PostgreSQL** for Database.

The Main Frameworks helping us achieve the solution were **.NET** and **Spring Boot**

Tiers are connected with **RESTful** and **gRPC** technologies.
